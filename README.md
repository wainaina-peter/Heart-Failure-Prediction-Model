# Understanding Heart Failure

## Analytical Question
Can one utilize already existing clinical data of heart patients to intelligently predict whether a person is at a risk of heart failure complication?

## Problem Statement
Heart failure is a serious health problem that many people experience and most of the time it comes at a surprise to learn that the issue had been underlying for years without being detected or it had been misdiagnosed for another disease.
As highlighted by Heartfoundation.org, heart failure is responsible for a significant number of deaths, with one person succumbing to heart failure every three hours, amounting to eight deaths per day. These alarming statistics underscore the urgent need for improved methods of detection and management. 
My goal is to create a machine learning model for predicting heart failure and as a result help in early diagnosis and improved onset treatment.

## Aims and objectives
### Main Objective.
To develop a machine learning model for predicting the risk of heart failure that will be utilizing available patient data and medical data available. 

### Specific Objectives.
1. To review and evaluate available data systematically and put together the dataset to train and evaluate the model.
2. To develop a model that predicts heart failure based on relevant input variables.
3. To evaluate the model against input data and test if it works according to expectation.

### Research questions
1. Is the available data evaluated and well curated to be split into train and test to build the model built on this dataset?
2. Can a person add in required variables and get an accurate heart failure rate prediction?
3. Does the model work as expected when evaluated against the input data?

## Scope
A heart rate prediction model will provide personalized insights into an individual's cardiovascular health. By considering factors such as age, gender, fitness level, and medical history, the model will tailor heart rate predictions to each individual's unique characteristics. 
This personalized approach allows for targeted interventions, lifestyle modifications, and preventive measures, ultimately improving patient outcomes and overall well-being. By accurately predicting heart rate, the model will help identify abnormal patterns that may indicate underlying cardiovascular conditions or potential risks. Early detection will allow for timely medical interventions, reducing the likelihood of complications and late diagnosis.
